# Renewed Vision PVP 3

*This module only supports PVP version 3.1 and above.*

Go to [Renewed Vision](https://renewedvision.com/provideoplayer/) to learn more about the software.

> ProVideoPlayer (PVP) is a Mac-based software application designed to play back and manipulate video across one or more screens.

> For over a decade, productions and installations have used ProVideoPlayer for playback to one or more screens along with other tools as part of the full rig: ProPresenter for text and CG, a video rig for camera shots and live produced content, and an expensive screen control system to pull it all together. For many events, a lot of powerful and expensive equipment is radically under-utilized, so we set out to see if we could make a single product that would provide the tools needed for many productions when the complexity of more expensive solutions is unnecessary. That is the vision realized with PVP3.



## Configuration

**Prepare PVP**

First open Preferences in PVP, open the Network tab, and enable network API support.

Choose a port to listen on. Make sure `Use HTTPS Connection` and `Require Authentication` are unchecked, as this module doesn't support those options yet.



**Configure Companion**

Enter in the IP address and port PVP is running on:

- **PVP IP**: The IP address of the PVP instance you want to control.
- **PVP Port**: The port PVP is running on (as shown in PVP's Preferences).



### Backup Instance

If you only have a single PVP instance, leave the following fields empty.

If you have two PVP installations that are running in a primary/backup mode, you may want actions to go to each PVP install to keep them in sync. Instead of creating two PVP instances in Companion and adding the same action for both instances, just add the backup PVP's connection information and let the module handle the work for you:

- **PVP IP (Backup instance)**: The IP address of the backup PVP instance.
- **PVP Port (Backup instance)**: The port the backup PVP instance.

All actions sent to the primary PVP instance will then be mirrored to the backup instance.

If you ever need to send an action to just one of the two PVP installations, you'll need to create a second PVP module instance in Companion and add those actions there.



**Relative Layer Opacities**

If you're using the relative layer opacity action and have a backup instance, please be aware that the opacity is relative to each instance's layer opacity. 



**Network Backup Triggering** 

PVP 3.2 added a network backup triggering mode, which can automatically keep two (or more) PVP instances in sync. This is a great solution if you're controlling PVP from its interface, but not so much if you control the master externally and it fails.

If you use the backup instance feature in this module, be sure to disable PVP's Network Backup Trigger feature.



## Important Notes

Whenever you see `Layer ID` or `Playlist ID` mentioned in an action, you can reference it in one of two ways:

- By its full name (as displayed in PVP). This is the easiest way. A name is case-sensitive.
- By its index. For example, the first layer has an index of `0`, the second has an index of `1`, etc.

Number IDs are always interpreted as indexes, even if a layer or playlist has a numeric name.

**Live Video:** A playlist ID of `-1` refers to the `Live Video` playlist.
